## The Frontend part for P2 plugin

---

## Build App

You do not need to do anything with frontend script to build this app. Just stand at the root, and
run `mvn package` as you always do to create a jar file.

## Resource

I learned from the following link:

First I search and found this link: [Atlassian Server Plugin Development - Use React - Atlas Kit in
Server Plugin](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/atlassian-server-plugin-development-use-react-atlas-kit-in-server-plugin/37527).
Then it leads me to so many other resources.
1. [Supercharge Your Server App's Front End with Atlaskit, React, Flow and More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pIudmkpHh0) (learned a lot)
2. [Fast, Performant and High-Quality Frontend App Development for Jira Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VamdjcJCc0Y) (learned a lot)
3. [wrm-webpack-example](https://bitbucket.org/serverecosystem/wrm-webpack-example) from
   [Fast, Performant and High-Quality Frontend App Development for Jira Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VamdjcJCc0Y).
   I actually copy the webpack config here, and I still have to go here to learn how to do hot
   reload, because currently I'm on Confluence, and atlas-run is super slow.
4. [WRM Plugin](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/atlassian-webresource-webpack-plugin)
5. [React Demo Plugin](https://bitbucket.org/scottdudley/devday-2019) from
   [Supercharge Your Server App's Front End with Atlaskit, React, Flow and More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pIudmkpHh0)
6. [Server Add-ons for Front-end Developers - AtlasCamp 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yf-TzKerVQ)
